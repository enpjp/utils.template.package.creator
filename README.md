# utils.template.package.creator
Makes template frameworks

## Background
This package supplies R commands to simplify the creation of R Studio templates that follow the principles originally developed by Paul Palmer. The basic idea is to extend the requirements of reproducible analysis into **reusable** templates that embody tools that will work for data from different sources. The practical realisation supplies skeleton templates that will load data from multiple files supplied in a **data-raw** directory.

Many files are presented in a human readable **wide-format**, often as spreadsheets. This is not a problem as these files may be parsed and transformed into the **long format** which forms the basis of most R analysis using code suggestions within the template. Multiple files in long-format that have common columns may be easily combined into a single convenient data object for reuse in downstream analysis.
