# utils.template.package.creator
Makes template frameworks

## Background
This package supplies R commands to simplify the creation of R Studio templates that follow the principles orginially developed by Paul Palmer. The basic idea is to extend the requirements of reproducible analysis into **reusable** templates that embody tools that will work for data from different sources. The practical realisation supplies skeleton templates that will load data from mulitple files supplied in a **data-raw** directory.

These files may be parsed and transformed into the **long format** which forms the basis of most R analysis using code suggestions within the template.
